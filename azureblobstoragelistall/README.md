# Azure Blob Storage List All Python example

This folder contains a Python application example that handles Blob storage on Microsoft Azure.

List the blobs in all Blob Storage containers in an Azure storage account.

## Requirements

* You must have a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) subscription.
* You must have an Azure storage account.
* The code was written for Python 3 and Azure SDKs for Python.
* Install the Azure SDKs for Python.

  Install the latest stable version (supports Python 2.7 and 3.x) via pip:

  ```bash
  pip install azure
  ```

## Using the code

* Configure your Azure access.

  You must create an Azure AD service principal in order to enable application to connect resources into Azure. The service principal grants your application to manage resources in your Azure subscription.

  The Azure SDKs Libraries for Java allow you to use several authentication schemes.

  The application uses an authentication file for authenticating.

  The credentials are taken from `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` environment variable.

  You can create a service principal and generate this file using Azure CLI 2.0 or using the Azure cloud shell.

  * Make sure you select your subscription by:

    ```bash
    az account set --subscription <name or id>
    ```

    and you have the privileges to create service principals.

  * Execute the following command for creating the service principal and the authentication file:
  
    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > my.azureauth
    ```
  
  * Set the `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` environment variable in your Operating System with the path of your authentication file.

    ```bash
    AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION = /path/to/my.azureauth
    ```

* Configure your storage account.

  An Azure storage account provides a unique namespace to store and access your Azure Storage data objects.
  
  There are two types of storage accounts:
  
  * A general-purpose storage account gives you access to Azure Storage services such as Tables, Queues, Files, Blobs and Azure virtual machine disks under a single account.

  * A Blob storage account is a specialized storage account for storing your unstructured data as blobs (objects) in Azure Storage.
    Blob storage accounts are similar to a existing general-purpose storage accounts and share all the great durability, availability,
    scalability, and performance features that you use today including 100% API consistency for block blobs and append blobs.

    For applications requiring only block or append blob storage, it is recommend using Blob storage accounts.

    Blob storage accounts expose the Access Tier attribute which can be specified during account creation and modified later as needed.

    There are two types of access tiers that can be specified based on your data access pattern:
    * A Hot access tier which indicates that the objects in the storage account will be more frequently accessed.
      This allows you to store data at a lower access cost.
    * A Cool access tier which indicates that the objects in the storage account will be less frequently accessed.
      This allows you to store data at a lower data storage cost.
  
  An storage account can content containers and every container can content blobs.

  ```bash
  Storage Account
              ├── Container_1/
              │   ├── Blob_1_1/
              │   └── Blob_1_2/
              │
              └── Container_2/
                  ├── Blob_2_1/
                  ├── Blob_2_2/
                  └── Blob_2_3/
  ```

  Create a storage account:
  
  1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
  2. Select the "Storage accounts" option. On the Storage Accounts window that appears, choose Add.
  3. Enter a name for your storage account.
  4. Specify the deployment model to be used: Resource Manager or Classic. Select Resource Manager deployment model.
  5. Select the type of storage account: General purpose or Blob storage. Select General purpose.
  6. Select the geographic location for your storage account.
  7. Select the replication option for the storage account: LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, or ZRS. Set Replication to Locally Redundant storage (LRS).
  8. Select the subscription in which you want to create the new storage account.
  9. Specify a new resource group or select an existing resource group.
  10. Click Create to create the storage account.

* Configure your Azure Storage connection string.

  The authentication information is required for your application to access data in an Azure Storage account at runtime.

  You need your account name and your account key. You can find this information in the Azure portal:
  
    1. Navigate to "Storage Accounts".
    2. Select your storage account.
    3. You can see your account name and account key, and get these:

    ```bash
    Storage account name
    ACCOUNT_NAME
    ```

    ```bash
    key1
    Key
    ACCOUNT_KEY
    ```
  
  We store the storage authentication information in a config file (`app.cfg`). The file content is:

  ```bash
  [StorageAuthentication]
  AccountName=<ACCOUNT_NAME>
  AccountKey=<ACCOUNT_KEY>
  ```

  You only need to edit the file `app.cfg` and change the values of:
  
  * `<ACCOUNT_NAME>` by the account name of your storage account.
  * `<ACCOUNT_KEY>` by the account key of your storage account.
  
  The application uses this information for accessing your Azure storage account.

* Run the code.

  You must edit the file `app.cfg` and change the values of:
  
  * `<ACCOUNT_NAME>` by the account name of your storage account.
  * `<ACCOUNT_KEY>` by the account key of your storage account.

  Run application:

  ```bash
  python blobstoragelistall.py
  ```

* Test the application.

    You should see the list of blobs in all Blob Storage containers in an Azure storage account.
