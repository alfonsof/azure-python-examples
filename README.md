# Python examples on Microsoft Azure

This repo contains Python code examples on Microsoft Azure.

These examples show how to use Python 3 and Azure SDK for Python in order to manage services on Microsoft Azure.

Azure SDK for Python allows Python developers to write software that makes use of Azure services like Virtual Machines and Blob storage.

## Quick start

You must have a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) subscription.

You must have an Azure storage account for the Azure Blob Storage examples.

The code for the samples is contained in individual folders on this repository. You can see the list:

**Storage - Azure Blob Storage:**

* [azureblobstoragecreate](/azureblobstoragecreate) - Azure Blob Storage Create: Example of how to handle Azure Blob Storage and create a new Blob Storage container in an Azure storage account.

* [azureblobstoragedelete](/azureblobstoragedelete) - Azure Blob Storage Delete: Example of how to handle Azure Blob Storage and delete a Blob Storage container in an Azure storage account.

* [azureblobstoragelist](/azureblobstoragelist) - Azure Blob Storage List: Example of how to handle Azure Blob Storage and list the blobs in a Blob Storage container in an Azure storage account.

* [azureblobstoragelistall](/azureblobstoragelistall) - Azure Blob Storage List All: Example of how to handle Azure Blob Storage and List the blobs in all Blob Storage containers in an Azure storage account.

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder.
